# Automobile-Customer-Segementation-with-RFM

In this Project, I will using RFM model to categorize customers into 6 types of customer segmentations, which make company have more detailed information about their each customers. 
Using Python's pandas.qcut() function to find value range in each 5 groups for: Rencency[5,4,3,2,1], Frequency[1,2,3,4,5] and Monetary[1,2,3,4,5]
And then using PostgreSQL to find out which segmentation that each customer belongs to

- `Promising` segmentation accounts for highest proportion(37), compared to the rest, followed by `Can't Lose Them`(13), `Lost`(13), `Recent Customer`(11), `About to Sleep`(8), `Hibernating`(7)
